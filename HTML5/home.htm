<p style="color:#002699;font-family:sans-serif> <pre align="center">At Ozone we build products out of Earth as health care is a highly individualized practice under <mark>Ayurvedic principles</mark>, which state that everyone has a specific constitution, or prakruti, that determines his or her physical, physiologic and mental character and disease vulnerability, according to Dr. Bala Manyam, a neurologist and professor emeritus at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine. <br><br>


Prakruti is determined by three "bodily energies" called doshas, Manyam told Live Science. There are <mark>three basic doshas</mark>, and though everyone has some features of each, most people have one or two that predominate, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center:

<br><br>
1.<mark>Pitta energy</mark> is linked to fire, and is thought to control the digestive and endocrine systems. People with pitta energy are considered fiery in temperament, intelligent and fast-paced. When pitta energy is out of balance, ulcers, inflammation, digestive problems, anger, heartburn and arthritis can result.



<br><br>

2.<mark>Vata energy</mark> is associated with air and space, and is linked to bodily movement, including breathing and blood circulation. Vata energy is said to predominate in people who are lively, creative, original thinkers. When out-of-balance, vata types can endure joint pain, constipation, dry skin, anxiety and other ailments.

<br><br>



3.<mark>Kapha energy</mark>, linked to earth and water, is believed to control growth and strength, and is associated with the chest, torso and back. Kapha types are considered strong and solid in constitution, and generally calm in nature. But obesity, diabetes, sinus problems, insecurity and gallbladder issues can result when kapha energy is out of balance, according to Ayurvedic practitioners.

<br><br>



According to Ayurvedic beliefs, factors such as stress, unhealthy diet, weather and strained relationships can all influence the balance that exists between a person's doshas. These unbalanced energies in turn leave individuals more susceptible to disease, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center.
